Kennedy on the day the President asked him to retire; it had been discovered by the public that he is an African American. As the Blue Marvel, Adam wore a full-face helmet, but when it was damaged in a battle, Adam's identity was revealed. A massive controversy ensued as the America of 1962 was too racist to accept a black superman. The President reluctantly decided to ask Adam to step back. Torn between myriad considerations, the Blue Marvel conceded.</p></a>

When Tyrone was 17, he and Billy witnessed the robbery of a local store and the fatal shooting of its clerk. The thieves fled, and Billy ran as well, fearing that he and Tyrone might be wrongly suspected of the crime. When a policeman ordered Billy to stop, Tyrone tried to proclaim Billy's innocence, but his stuttering made it impossible to speak clearly, and the officer shot Billy dead. Feeling responsible for Billy's death and afraid of the police, Johnson ran away to New York City.</p></a>

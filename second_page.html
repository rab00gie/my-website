        <p>darwin <br>Born a strange looking mutant, Armando Munoz was left alone with his mother at age 4 after his father rejected him and left. His mother resented Armando for his father's selfishness and Armando resolved to make her happy again. Four years later, testing revealed his genius-level intelligence and private academies offered to fund continuing education; which of course pleased his mother, albeit not for reasons Arando would hope for. His mother gladly enrolled him in the Biltmore Academy boarding school, where he was bullied relentlessly for years due to his appearance until, at age 15, his latent mutant ability manifested and he fought back, subconsciously hardening his hands and beating the bullies unconscious. Later, during a visit home, he saved his mother's life after her smoking caused a fire. The senior scientist at Biltmore tested Armando and published a paper about his ability that 'outed' him as a mutant and dubbed him "Darwin, the Evolving Boy."</p>

        <p>bishop <br>Born in the 21st century A.D. in the alternate future timeline of Earth-1191, Lucas Bishop enters a world in which the mutant-hunting robot Sentinels controlled North America following the birth of a mutant child restarting Earth’s mutant population after its decimation on “M-Day.” In this timeline, the Sentinels kill Professor Charles Xavier and most of the members of the mutant team he founded, the X-Men. Surviving mutants are hunted down and imprisoned within mutant relocation camps or killed. Bishop’s parents escape to America shortly before a tactical nuclear strike decimated Australia; however, they are soon captured and interred in a mutant relocation camp in Sheep’s Head Bay in Brooklyn, New York. </p>

        <p>squirrle girl <br> Squirrel Girl possesses enhanced strength, speed, agility, and reflexes. A super humanly nimble acrobat gifted at climbing trees, she can perform standing high jumps of at least 30 feet. Small claws on each digit enhance her gripping and climbing and are also useful to some extent as weapons in hand-to-hand fighting. Her right hand contains a retractable knuckle spike, larger and more durable than her claws, which can easily carve wood. Her enlarged incisors can chew through solid wood. She has a bushy, semi-prehensile tail, roughly six feet long, which enhances her sense of balance—she can also use it to cover her opponents’ eyes, or to wrap around herself for warmth or protection. Highly flexible, the tail can be fully concealed beneath civilian clothes, albeit somewhat uncomfortably.

          Able to mimic squirrel vocalizations perfectly, she can fluently communicate with them and direct their actions, often commanding large numbers simultaneously. She frequently uses multiple squirrels to distract, disorient, or even assault her opponents, and these animal allies often chew through circuitry, wiring, clothing and other materials, attacking targets with their teeth and claws.</p>
